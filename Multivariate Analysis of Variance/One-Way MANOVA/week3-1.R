#Alternative hypothesis: At least one sample mean is not equal to the others.

# Summary of the analysis
summary(res.aov)

##As the p-value is less than the significance level 0.05, we can conclude that there are significant differences between the groups highlighted with â€œ*" in the model summary.

##Tukey multiple pairwise-comparisons
#As the ANOVA test is significant, we can compute Tukey HSD (Tukey Honest Significant Differences, R function: TukeyHSD()) for performing multiple pairwise-comparison between the means of groups.

#The function TukeyHD() takes the fitted ANOVA as an argument.
TukeyHSD(res.aov)
##It can be seen from the output, that only the difference between high and low is significant with an adjusted p-value of 0.001.
#Check ANOVA assumptions: test validity?

# 1. Homogeneity of variances
plot(res.aov, 1)
#points 39, 143, and 158 are detected as outliers, which can severely affect normality and homogeneity of variance. It can be useful to remove outliers to meet the test assumptions.


#use Bartlett's test or Levene's test to check the homogeneity of variances.

leveneTest(MATHSACH ~ SES, data = school_anova)
#From the output above we can see that the p-value is not less than the significance level of 0.05. This means that there is no evidence to suggest that the variance across groups is statistically significantly different. Therefore, we can assume the homogeneity of variances in the different treatment groups.
qqnorm(school_anova$MATHSACH)

# 2. Normality
plot(res.aov, 2)
#As all the points deviate from the reference line, we can not assume normality.
# Extract the residuals
aov_residuals <- residuals(object = res.aov )
# Run Shapiro-Wilk test
shapiro.test(x = aov_residuals )
##The conclusion above, is supported by the Shapiro-Wilk test on the ANOVA residuals (W = 0.98, p = 0.004) 
#p-value is less than 0.05, then the null hypothesis that the data are normally distributed is rejected
